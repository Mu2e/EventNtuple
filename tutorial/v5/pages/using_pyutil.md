## Purpose

We have a python utility package here: TrkAna/utils/mu2epyutil.py.

This can be imported into a python analysis. See TrkAna/utils/test.py for an example of how to use.

## Using

* set up the current python test area:

```
source /exp/mu2e/app/users/sophie/pyana-tests/sophie-pyana/bin/activate
```

* import the util into your python script:

```
from mu2epyutil import EvtNtuple_util as evn
```

That's it!
