## Validation

We want to make sure that any changes we make to the code don't:
* stop fcl files from working, or
* change the content of the EventNtuple unexpectedly

### Validating EventNtuple Runs
From ```EventNtuple/``` directory:

```
. ./validation/test_fcls.sh
```

This script will run all the supported fcl files over relevant datasets. All tests should report ```OK```

### Validating EventNtuple Contents

Before making any changes, create a TrkAna file and run the validation script. This creates a new ROOT file with histograms created from the TrkAna ntuple:

```
mu2e -c TrkAna/fcl/TrkAnaReco.fcl -S filelist.txt --TFileName nts.trkana.before.root

root -l -b TrkAna/validation/create_val_file.C\(\"nts.trkana.before.root\",\"val.trkana.before.root\"\)
```

Then make your changes, rebuild the code and then re-run:

```
mu2e -c TrkAna/fcl/TrkAnaReco.fcl -S filelist.txt --TFileName nts.trkana.after.root

root -l -b TrkAna/validation/create_val_file.C\(\"nts.trkana.after.root\",\"val.trkana.after.root\"\)
```

Finally, to compare the two sets of histograms we use [valCompare](https://mu2ewiki.fnal.gov/wiki/Validation#valCompare)

```
valCompare -p trkana-validation-booklet.pdf -r val.trkana.before.root val.trkana.after.root
```

We should have perfect matches between all histograms. However, in some rare instances, we may expect differences. If you see any non-perfect matches, then discuss with the TrkAna experts.
