# How to get help -- ```ntuplehelper```

On this page, you will learn how to use the [```ntuplehelper```](../../utils/ntuplehelper.py) utility to get more information about what the different branches and leaves are. You will need to be in a EventNtuple environment e.g.

```
mu2einit
muse setup EventNtuple
```

You can use this utility:

* on the command line:

```
ntuplehelper dem.nhits demmcsim.*
```

* on the ROOT command lineL
```
root[0] .! ntuplehelper dem.nhits demmcsim.*
```

* from within python:

```
>>> import ntuplehelper
>>> nthelper = ntuplehelper.nthelper()
>>> nthelper.whatis(['dem.hits', 'demmcsim.*'])
```

The above produces this output:

```
dem (dem = downstream e-minus fit): array branch containing general information about all reconstructed track
dem.nhits:     int nhits = 0;     // number of hits associated to this track

demmcsim (dem = downstream e-minus fit): branch to record SimParticles in genealogy
demmcsim.*:
    bool valid = false; // true/false as to whether the data is valid
    int nhits = -1; // number of matched hits in the track generated by this particle
    int nactive = -1; // number of active matched hits in the track generated by this particle
    int rank = -1; // rank of this particle, by # of associated hits
    int pdg = -1; // true PDG code
    int startCode = -1; // creation process code
    int stopCode = -1; // stop process code
    int gen = -1; // generator code
    float time = -1.0;  // Origin time of the SimParticle [ns]
    XYZVectorF mom = XYZVectorF();  // origin momentumof the SimParticle [MeV/c]
    XYZVectorF pos = XYZVectorF();  // origin position of the SimParticle [mm, in detector coords]
    XYZVectorF endmom = XYZVectorF();  // end momentumof the SimParticle [MeV/c]
    XYZVectorF endpos = XYZVectorF();  // end position of the SimParticle [mm, in detector coords]
    MCRelationship prirel = MCRelationship(); // relationship to the event primary particles
    MCRelationship trkrel = MCRelationship(); // relationship to the particle that created hits in the track
```

Note that a wildcard ```*``` for the leaf will print a description of all leaves on that branch

See [the validation script for more examples](../../validation/ntuplehelper-test.py)

## For developers

The ```ntuplehelper``` works when individual structs are in separate header files and contains a comment line like:

```
// StructName: a branch that contains something
```

and individual variables have their own line formatted like:

```
type  leafname = default_value; // comment explaining the leaf
```
