## Event Branches

These branches contain one element per event.

| tcnt |  Single objects branch |   counts track types and track-related quantities in an event (MARKED FOR REMOVAL)| [see TrkCount.hh](../inc/TrkCount.hh)
## Track Branches

Each element in these branch corresponds to a different Kalman fit hypotheses to reconstruct the track:

In most cases, there are 4 different Kalman fit hypotheses:
- downstream electron

- downstream positron

- downstream negative muon

- downstream positive muon


In case the track is reflected (it has an upstream leg and a downstream leg), then each event contains 8 elements, the last 4 being upstream equivalent of the 4 listed above.

If a Kalman fit fails or there are multiple downstream tracks to fit, the number of element may vary.

## Track segments Branches

These branches contain 4 elements per event corresponding to different Kalman fit hypotheses (see Track branches).

Within each Kalman fit element, there is a vector describing the track segment parameters when intersecting virtual detectors (identified by their surface id sid).

## Straw Branches

These branches contain a vector in which each element lists the properties of a straw hits in the tracker.

The number of elements in the vector is found in the leaf trk.nhits.

## Monte Carlo Branches

These branches contain 4 elements per event corresponding to different Kalman fit hypotheses (see Track branches).

Within each Kalman fit element, there is a vector containing Monte Carlo truth information about the particle making the track and its parent particles.

The vector is sorted in reverse chronological order, such that the last element is the initial particle simulated in GEANT4, and each element before correspond to one of its daughter particles.

## Calorimeter Branches

These branches are vectors of calorimeter clusters/hits/recodigis/digis that happened during the event.
While each branch can be read independently, i.e. all the hits of the event, each element contains indexes to the other branches for parentage link.
The cluster element contains the vector 'hits_' containing the indexes of the hits branch belonging to this cluster.
Similarly, each hit contains the indexes of its two recodigis (left and right channels) and the index of its parent cluster.
Example: cluster 3 has hits_ = {12, 13, 14, 15}. Each of those hits will have 'clusterIdx_' = 3.

## CRV Branches

These branches contain a vector where each element is a CRV hit that happened during the event.
The branch is empty if there are no CRV hit during the event.
