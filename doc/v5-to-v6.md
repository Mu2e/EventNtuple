# Major Changes from v5 to v6

There was a major update when we moved from v5 to v6. Here are tables of changes for you to consult. Note that the same change may appear in multiple tables since it may be important in one area but defined in another. For example, the folder name is defined in fcl but is also important to know in the Tree / Branch / Leaf Changes.

Instructions for developers to upgrade their development areas are [here](v5-to-v6_developers.md)

## Tree / Branch / Leaf Changes

| TrkAnaReco_ceSimReco.fcl | from_mcs-ceSimReco.fcl | for running on the output of ceSimReco.fcl |
| TrkAnaRecoEnsemble-Data.fcl | from_mcs-mockdata_noMC.fcl | for running on mock data with no MC information |
| TrkAnaDeM.fcl | only #includes updated |  |
| TrkAnaDeMFromDigis.fcl | only #includes updated |  |

| TrkAnaReflections.fcl | only #includes updated |  |
| TrkAnaTrigger.fcl | only #includes updated |  |
| TrkAnaTriggerFromDigis.fcl | only #includes updated |  |
| TrkAnaRecoEnsemble-MC.fcl | deleted | use from_mcs-mockdata.fcl instead|
| TrkAnaReco_mergedKalSeeds.fcl | deleted | all track types in one branch is now the default |
| CrvExpert.fcl | deleted | |
| TrkAnaReco_wTrkQualFilter.fcl | deleted | |
| TrkAnaReco_addMCUpstream.fcl | deleted | |
| TrkAnaReco_addStopTgtVDs.fcl | deleted | |
| TrkAnaReco_multipleBestCrv.fcl | deleted | |
| TrkAnaReco_multipleBestCrv_differentThresholds.fcl | deleted | |
| TrkAnaReco_MultipleTrkQual.fcl | deleted | |

## Fcl Parameter Changes 
|  | v5 | v6 | Notes |

| prolog.fcl table name | ```TrkAnaTreeMaker``` | ```EventNtupleMaker``` | the table that contains the default module configuration |
| prolog.fcl physics block | ```TrkAnaReco``` | ```EventNtuple``` | the block that contains ```producers```, ```analyzers```, etc. |
| prolog.fcl path names | ```Sequence``` | ```Path``` | for consistency with previous stages of processing|
| EventNtupleMaker module parameter | ```ProcessEmptyEvents``` | removed | not used anywhere |
